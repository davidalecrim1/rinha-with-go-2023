# Rinha de Backend with Go (Edition 2023/Q3)
I’m using this to learn new things from the latest editions with **Go**. I haven’t participated, but I’m considering giving it a try in the next ones.

## Getting Started
* Install Docker
* Run `docker compose up -d --build` or `make build-and-run`

## Stack
- `net/http` for REST API.
- Nginx as Reserve Proxy for Load Balacing
- Postgres as Database
- `pgx and pgxpool` for Postgres Driver

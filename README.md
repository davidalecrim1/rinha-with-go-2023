# Rinha de Backend (2023/Q3)
I’m using this to learn new things from the latest editions. I haven’t participated, but I’m considering giving it a try in the next ones.

## Good to Know
`docker-compose.dev.yml` is for testing locally while developing.
`docker-compose.qa.yml` is for the load testing.

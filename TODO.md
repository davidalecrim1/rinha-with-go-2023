- create an alternativa branch and test with some frameworks like fiber and gin (just for fun, net/http is more than enough)
- try out the bulk insert used by leo vargas using redis for cache and a worker to insert it in the database
- test explain analize with gist and with gin and without any of those to see the execution time.
- test cpu profiling to see if there are slow functions
